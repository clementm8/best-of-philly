						<h2>Philly Chesesteak Pizza</h2>
					<p>Okay, so this pizza? It's basically comfort food heaven. I've tried a lot of different recipes for this dish and nothing beats this one. The Alfredo sauce is really creamy and i like that because nobody wants a dry pizza, and the provolone and mozzarella gives it that gooey, cheesy stretch. The steak was tender enough and flavorful without being over-seasoned, so it blended well with the peppers and onions - those added a nice crunch and just enough sweetness. The ingredients are really easy to source, you can easily find them in your local grocery stores, but the most important ingredient is love. In conclusion, this recipe is a banger! I have zero regrets and i'll definitely be making it again.
						<h4>What would I do differently next time?</h4>
						<p>I'd definitely add some caramelized onions because they'd blend right in with the steak and add a little more depth. Also, how about tossing on some pineapple? - who doesn't love a little debate about whether pineapple belongs on pizza?  </p>
						<p>I'd also try playing around with adding and substituting the ingredients. Here's a few things i'd swap out and why</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Portobello mushrooms marinated in Olive oil and Vinegar instead of Ribeye Steak- They have a meaty texture and rich flavor that can mimic the satisfaction of steak, you're welcome veggie lovers!</li>
							<li>Melted Butter Pizza Crust instead of a plain crust- I've had this on other pizzas and it really adds a rich buttery flavor to the crust.</li>
							<li>Truffle Oil: I drizzle truffle oil on a lot of dishes that go in the oven and i think it would be a great add. It has a very rich and earthy aroma. </li>
							<li>Roasted Red Peppers Instead of Green Bell Peppers: Roasted Red Peppers are sweeter, have a pop of color, and have a smoky flavor.</li>
						</ul>

						<h2>Oxtail Cheesesteak Sandwich</h2>
						<p>This article is proof that Philly's iconic cheesesteak keeps evolving through different traditions and cultural influences. Ernest, once a die-hard fan of the classic Philly cheesesteak, stumbled across a viral video about an oxtail cheesesteak—and wow, right?! The folks at Taste Cheesesteak Bar in Center City have really taken things to the next level, blending bold flavors, heritage, and Philly's growing food diversity into something that feels both fresh and familiar.</p>
							<p>The highlight of the piece is how the oxtail cheesesteak brings the best of both worlds—rich Caribbean flavors and Philly staples. I've had oxtail before, and I can already tell it would create some serious chemistry with a cheesesteak. Imagine this: slow-braised oxtail marinated in a Haitian spice blend (“epis”), layered with gooey Cooper Sharp cheese, and all packed into a soft, fresh Liscio's Bakery roll. It sounds like a dream come true. Plus, the chef's personal connection to the recipe, inspired by his mom's Haitian cooking, makes it so much more than just food. It's a full-on celebration of culture and identity.</p>
							<p>What I really love about this article is how Ernest goes from being skeptical to totally sold on the idea. In their words, "To say I was “influenced” was an understatement. But why? I would argue that it's all in the meat and spices." It's a great reminder that sometimes it takes stepping out of your comfort zone to discover something amazing. Ernest makes it clear that the oxtail cheesesteak isn't just another food trend—it's a true reflection of how Philly's food scene is continuing to grow and evolve.</p>
							<p>I'm really glad I stumbled across this article, and I'm excited for anyone else who gets to read it. If you weren't already curious about this crazy-good combo of flavors, trust me—you will be now. It's a perfect example of how even classics like the Philly cheesesteak can be elevated through creativity and cultural fusion. And if this article doesn't make you crave an oxtail cheesesteak, I'm not sure what will!</p>

							<p>Here's a <a style="color: green;" href="https://philly.eater.com/24185442/oxtail-cheesesteak-best-version-philly-classic">link to Ernest's</a> article.</p>
						
						<h4>What would I do differently next time?</h4>
						<p>So i wouldn't change anything of the ingredients but i'd definitely consider turning this into a pizze. Maybe throw in some plantains as toppings or in the crust.</p>

						<H2>My Favorite Picnic Spot</H2>
						<p>
							My favorite picnic spot in Edmonton has to be Constable Ezio Faraone Park. It's such a hidden gem with tons of open space, big shady trees, and a beautiful little lake that’s perfect for unwinding. I like relaxing with some good food, staring at clouds, and soaking up the sun. Plus, it's super easy to get to—just take Groat Road NW and turn onto Emily Murphy Park Road NW. Trust me, you'll find plenty of great spots to settle in!
						</p>
					</div>
					
					<!-- <div class="ingredients">
					<p><strong>For the Crust:</strong></p>
					<ul>
						<li>1 pre-made pizza dough (store-bought or homemade)</li>
					</ul>
					<p><strong>For the Sauce:</strong></p>
					<ul>
						<li>1/2 cup Alfredo sauce (for a rich, creamy base so the steak and cheese shine)</li>
					</ul>
					<p><strong>Toppings:</strong></p>
					<ul>
						<li>1 cup mozzarella cheese, shredded</li>
						<li>1 cup provolone cheese, shredded (a must for that authentic Philly taste!)</li>
						<li>1/2 lb ribeye steak, thinly sliced (the more tender, the better)</li>
						<li>1/2 green bell pepper, thinly sliced</li>
						<li>1/2 red bell pepper, thinly sliced</li>
						<li>1/2 yellow onion, thinly sliced</li>
						<li>Olive oil (for cooking the steak)</li>
						<li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
					</ul>
					<p><strong>Optional Finishes:</strong></p>
					<ul>
						<li>Fresh chopped parsley for garnish</li>
						<li>Crushed red pepper flakes for a little extra kick</li>
					</ul>
					</div>
					<div class="instructions">
						<h3>Instructions</h3>
						<ol>
							<li>Prep the Steak and Veggies:
								<ul>
									<li>In a skiller, heat up a splash of olive oil over medium-high heat. Lightly season your ribeye slices with salt and pepper.</li>
									<li>Sear the steak slices in the skillet for just a minute or two on each side, until browned but still tender, then set aside.</li>
									<li>In the same skillet, toss in the sliced peppers and onions, and cook for about 4-5 minutes until they're soft but still have a slight crunch.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>Preheat and Prepare the Crust:
								<ul>
									<li>Place a rack in the center of the oven and preheat it to 475ºF. .</li>
									<li>Roll out your pizza dough on a floured surface into a 12 inch circle and transfer it to a pizza stone or baking sheet. Let dough rest for 15-20 minutes while you prepare the sauce.
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>Assemble the Pizza:
								<ul>
									<li>Spread the Alfredo sauce evenly over the crust, leaving a slight border around the edges.</li>
									<li>Layer on the mozzarella and provolone cheeses. With this, every bite will be packed with gooey, melty goodness.</li>
									<li>Add the steak slices, peppers, and onions generously over the cheese.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>Bake:
								<ul>
									<li>Bake your pizza for 10-12 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly and the crust is golden.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>Finish and Serve:
								<ul>
									<li>Once out of the oven, garnish with a sprinkle of chopped parsley or a dash of crushed red pepper flakes. Slice and serve hot!</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ol>
						<p><strong>A Final Tip:</strong> If you want to get creative, you can drizzle a bit of garlic aioli on top or serve with a side of hot sauce for dipping.</p>
