				<h3>My first Philly CheeseSteak Pizza</h3>
				<p>The first time I tried a Philly cheesesteak pizza, I was at a restaurant watching the 2016 NBA Finals
					with friends. I vividly remember the server bringing the pizza to our table and how the smell caught
					everyone's attention. As I took a bite, the crispy, golden crust gave way to a rich layer of melted
					provolone and mozzarella cheese, that covered tender strips of well-seasoned beef. Each mouthful was
					a perfect mix of flavors: the juicy steak paired wonderfully with caramelized onions and bell
					peppers, all topped with a zesty marinara sauce that had just the right amount of spice. The smell
					was mouthwatering, with hints of garlic and pepper that made the whole experience even better. It
					was an amazing combination of two classic dishes that completely exceeded my expectations.</p>

						<h3>What's in a Philly Cheesesteak Pizza</h3>
						<p>A Philly cheesesteak pizza combines the classic flavors of a Philly cheesesteak sandwich with
							a pizza base, creating a delicious fusion dish. The pizza is typically topped with thinly
							sliced ribeye steak or beef, which is often sautéed with onions and green bell peppers to
							add savory depth. Mozzarella and provolone cheeses are commonly used to melt over the
							toppings, giving a creamy, stretchy texture. Some versions include mushrooms and other
							vegetables like banana peppers for extra flavor. The base can be a traditional tomato sauce
							or a white sauce, depending on preference, and sometimes drizzles of cheese whiz or garlic
							butter are added for that authentic Philly cheesesteak touch. The result is a hearty,
							flavorful pizza that pays homage to the beloved Philadelphia sandwich.</p>

						<h3>Which Cheese Works Best for Pizza Philly Cheesesteak?</h3>
						<p>

							The most commonly used cheese used in the Philly Cheesesteak Pizza Provolone are Cheeze,
							&nbsp;Whiz, and American cheese . &nbsp;Personally, I use mozzarella and Alfredo sauce.
							&nbsp;The mozzarella melts to a deliciously mushy, buttery cheesiness. &nbsp;If you're
							feeling adventurous, you can add layer provolone over the Alfredo sauce. This creates a
							wonderful depth of flavor, with the provolone adding a tangy kick that pairs perfectly with
							the creamy Alfredo. Whether you stick to the classics or venture into new territory, cheese
							is the key to making this pizza both satisfying and unforgettable</p>

				<h3>History of Philly Cheesesteak Pizza</h3>
				<p>The Philly cheesesteak pizza is a modern twist on Philadelphia's iconic cheesesteak sandwich, which
					dates back to the 1930s when Pat and Harry Olivieri first created the sandwich with thinly sliced
					steak and onions. Over time, cheese was added, and the sandwich became a Philadelphia favorite. As
					pizza grew in popularity across the U.S., pizzerias began experimenting with regional dishes,
					leading to the creation of the Philly cheesesteak pizza in the late 20th century. This pizza
					combines the essential cheesesteak ingredients—steak, onions, peppers, and melted cheese—on a pizza
					crust, offering a new way to enjoy the flavors of the classic sandwich. Today, its a popular
					choice, especially in the Philadelphia area, blending the city's beloved sandwich with the comfort
					of pizza..</p>
